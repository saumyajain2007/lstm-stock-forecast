# LSTM Stock ForecastðŸ“ˆ LSTM Stock Price Forecast
Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a robust solution for time-series forecasting of stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, built with TensorFlow and Keras.

The project is designed to be highly reproducible, utilizing yfinance to fetch real-time historical data and providing a Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration of the model's performance and predictions.

Key Features
Data Acquisition: Automatically fetch historical stock price data for any ticker via the popular yfinance library.

Data Preprocessing: Implement standard techniques including data scaling (MinMaxScaler) and sequence generation to prepare time-series data for the LSTM model.

Model Architecture: Define, train, and validate a sequence-to-sequence LSTM model using the Keras API.

Forecasting: Generate future price predictions and visualize the results against actual historical data.

Interactive Notebook: A detailed Jupyter notebook (notebooks/LSTM_Forecasting.ipynb) provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire process.

Code Quality: Unit tests (tests/) and continuous integration via GitHub Actions are included to ensure model reliability and code integrity.

Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get your local environment running.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

3. Install Dependencies
Install all necessary libraries, including tensorflow, keras, yfinance, and pandas.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Assuming a requirements.txt file exists with the necessary dependencies)

Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook
The easiest way to interact with the project is through the provided notebook.

jupyter notebook

Open notebooks/LSTM_Forecasting.ipynb and run the cells sequentially. You can easily modify the target stock ticker, lookback window, and model parameters directly within the notebook.

2. Run Unit Tests
To verify that the data fetching and processing utilities are working correctly, run the test suite:

pytest
